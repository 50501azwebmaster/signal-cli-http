# Signal-CLI HTTP

**Very** early in development.

Very simple HTTP frontend to [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli).

Please also read the following README files for the individual modules:

* [args](args/readme.md) - handles command line arguments.
* [conf](conf/readme.md) - handles the config file.
